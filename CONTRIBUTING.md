## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Check for existing issues**: Before opening a new issue, check if the issue has already been reported.
2. **Create a new issue**: If it hasn’t been reported, create a new issue with a clear and concise description. Please include as much detail as possible:
   - The problem or feature request.
   - Steps to reproduce (if it’s a bug).
   - Expected behavior.

### Making Changes

If you'd like to make changes to the code, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**: 
   - Click the "Fork" button at the top right of this repository to create a personal copy of the repository.
   
2. **Clone your fork**:

     cd sas-defensive-check-macro
     ```

3. **Create a new branch**: 
   - Always create a new branch for your changes. This helps keep your work separate from the main codebase.
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature-name
     ```

4. **Make your changes**:
   - Make the changes in your local copy of the repository. Be sure to follow the existing coding style and best practices.

     git commit -m "Add new feature or fix bug"
     ```

6. **Push your changes**:
   - Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:
     ```bash
     git push origin feature-name
     ```

7. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
   - Go to your repository on GitHub, and you should see a prompt to create a pull request.
   - Choose the "main" branch of the original repository as the base and your branch as the compare branch.
   - Provide a description of your changes and submit the pull request.

### Pull Request Review

- Once your pull request is submitted, the repository maintainers will review your changes.
- If necessary, they may suggest changes or improvements.
- Once the pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main codebase.
